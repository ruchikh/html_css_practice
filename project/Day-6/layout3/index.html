			<div class="inline-block">Notice the space between them. It occurs because of my carriage return in the HTML which I've used to keep the code organized. I've used a reset to insure no elements should have any default margins or padding. (I did add a bottom margin to make it easier to read.) This space is actually a space character rendered just as it would be between two inline elements.</div>
